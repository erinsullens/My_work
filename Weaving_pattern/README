This is a project in progress. It is a program that has the user draw a desired weaving pattern on a grid, and allows the user to preview what the full pattern would look like.
When finished, the program will then take the weaving "picture" and calculate the warping pattern, how to tie the pedals/levers, and the weaving instructions.
